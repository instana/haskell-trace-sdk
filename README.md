Instana Haskell Trace SDK
=========================

Monitor your Haskell application with Instana! ðŸŽ‰

Disclaimer
----------

The Instana Haskell Trace SDK is a labor of love from some of our engineers and work on it is done in their spare time. Haskell is currently not a platform that we officialy support. The experience may differ from other programming languages and platforms that Instana actively supports (such as Java, .NET, Node.js, Python, Ruby, Go, PHP, ...). That said, the SDK is a fully functional piece of software, so don't let this disclaimer discourage you from using it. If you use Instana or consider using it and Haskell support is crucial for you, make sure to give us a ping and let's talk about it.

What The Haskell Trace SDK Is And What It Is Not
------------------------------------------------

The Instana Haskell Trace SDK does not support automatic instrumentation/tracing in the way we support it in most other languages. Instead, the SDK enables you to create spans manually, much like the [Instana Trace SDK for Java](https://docs.instana.io/core_concepts/tracing/java_trace_sdk/) does. Besides offering a convenient API to create spans, the Haskell Trace SDK also takes care of establishing a connection to the Instana Agent and sending spans to the agent in an efficient way, that does not impede the performance of your production code.

Usage
-----

TODO Document usage: installation (cabal, ...), typical usage with code snippets, link to API docs

Configuration
-------------

TODO Document configuration mechanisms (via code versus via environment variables versus default values)

TODO Document environment variables.

* `INSTANA_AGENT_HOST`
* `INSTANA_AGENT_PORT`
* `INSTANA_FORCE_TRANSMISSION_STARTING_AFTER`
* `INSTANA_FORCE_TRANSMISSION_STARTING_AT`
* `INSTANA_MAX_BUFFERED_SPANS`
* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL`: See section "Configure Debug Logging".
* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT`: See section "Configure Debug Logging".
* `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`: See section "Configure Debug Logging".


### Configure Debug Logging

If required, the Instana Haskell SDK can produce logs via [hslogger](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hslogger). Under normal circumstances, the SDK does not emit any log output at all. It will only output log messages when logging is explicitly enabled via certain environment variables. This can be useful to troubleshoot tracing in production settings or during development.

#### Logging Related Environment Variables

* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL`: Sets the log level for SDK's log file. The log file will be written to the system's temporary directory (in particular, whatever `System.Directory.getTemporaryDirectory` returns) as `instana-haskell-sdk.{pid}.log`.
* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT`: Sets the level for emitting log messages to stdout.
* `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`: Controls whether the SDK sets an hslogger at the root logger level, see below.

#### When To Set `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER`

Setting up hslogger correctly inside a library like the Instana Haskell SDK (as opposed to an application which has full control) can be tricky. For the Instana Haskell SDK to be able to correctly configure hslogger, it is important to know whether the app in question (or some part of it) already uses hslogger. In particular, does some part of the code set a handler on hslogger's root logger? Is a call like the following executed somewhere in the application?

```
import System.Log.Logger (rootLoggerName, setHandlers, updateGlobalLogger)

updateGlobalLogger rootLoggerName $ setHandlers [...]
```

If this is the case, you can simply use `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL` (or `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT`) without further configuration. If the app in question does not use hslogger, that is if no `setHandler` call on `rootLoggerName` is executed, you should also set
`INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER` to a non-empty string (for example, `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER=true`).

#### Troubleshooting Tracing In Production

If your app already uses hslogger, use:

* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`

Otherwise, use:

* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER=true`

#### Development

During development (that is, working on the Instana Haskell SDK), use either

* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT=DEBUG`

or

* `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT=DEBUG`
* `INSTANA_OVERRIDE_HSLOGGER_ROOT_HANDLER=true`

depending on whether the application already uses and configures hslogger. The application `sample-app` that is contained in the Instana Haskell SDK's repo configures hslogger, so simply using `INSTANA_LOG_LEVEL_STDOUT=DEBUG` is correct.
